### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate blockchain engineer and fullstack developer, focused now on Data Analytics in the Defi space. My previous job involved also fullstack development lifecycle: architecting secure smart contracts with Solidity and Rust, and then building the user-facing applications using TypeScript, modern frameworks (Vue/React/Next/Angular), and mobile technologies like React Native and Flutter.

### 🚀 My last Project

- **ChillSplit** – A group expense tracker, fully On-Chain.
  - Focusing on abstracting most of the web3 friction (using Dynamic.xyz wallet with hidden signatures, gas sponsorship, EIP 7702, 2612)
  - No direct "wallet" interactions for the user in the app, except for the ON-Ramping (=funding the wallet) process
  - Each group has a smart contract to manage expenses, approvals, and settlement.

- Live on Base Sepolia: [Try it](https://chill-split.vercel.app)

### 🧪 Previous Side Projects 

<br />

- **Gotcha**
  
  A simple, open-source platform to share ideas, business concepts, or everyday gripes. Its purpose is to have a central hub for thinkers to post problems and builders to find inspiration and even collaborate.
  - Login with Privy (email, Google, Twitter, Discord, Github, Passkeys)
  - NextJS, Supabase, TanStack Query, zod, etc..

- **Ride The Bet (Chiliz Hackathon)**

  A decentralized prediction market built solo in 18 hours.
  
  Fans and influencers create prediction bets by staking Fan Tokens (like $PSG).
  Users upvote (agree) or downvote (disagree), with the winning pool sharing the entire losing stake.
  
  Features on-chain influencer identities, a gamified leaderboard, and smooth blockchain interactions with Thirdweb.

- **No-code LayerZero OFT MCP Server**

  A Node.js MCP server for creating, deploying, and bridging Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) across multiple chains using LayerZero.  
  Designed for integration with agents and LLMs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
  Features:
  - Deploy and auto-configure OFTs on multiple testnets
  - **Same address** on every chain
  - Bridge tokens between supported chains
  - Built for LLM use via Claude for Desktop or similar tools

<br />

- **LayerZero OFT DApp**

  A visual interface built with React/Vite to **deploy & bridge** with LayerZero OFTs (Omnichain Fungible Tokens).
  **Deploy OFTs** across testnets with wallet integration
  Deterministic **same-address** deployment on **every chain** using CREATE2
  Token **bridging** across chains via LayerZero
  Powered by Wagmi, Viem, and TailwindCSS

- **Loyalty Pay**
    
  The project is a **Solana-based** loyalty rewards dApp that enables **merchants** to create **on-chain loyalty** programs for their customers.
  - The merchant can enter the amount he wants to receive, generate a **QR-code**, and then the customer scans it and everything is handled in a **single transaction** (paiement, rewards processing, nft mint/upgrade for the client, etc)

- **Token Weighted MultiSig Diamond**
     
  An experimental repo exploring advanced multi-signature mechanisms using the EIP-2535 Diamond Standard for upgradability and governance logic owned by token holders.
  - Traditional multisig logic using owner approvals (main branch) 
  - Facet upgrades (`diamondCut`) gated by multisig confirmations (branch n°2) 
  - A novel multisig model based on users’ ERC20 balances as voting weights (branch n°3)

- **ERC-20 Token Alternative**
    
  ERC-1919 is a project I started after seeing the idea on Crypto Twitter. The purpose was to replace traditional DEX and LP-based trading.
  It introduces a fully on-chain trading model where:
     - Trades happen exclusively via smart contracts — no DEX, no liquidity pools.
     - Mint on buy / Burn on sell — users send ETH to mint tokens, or send tokens to redeem ETH.
     - Algorithmic pricing via “price levels” — price increases or decreases with each level based on volume.
     - No supply manipulation — levels control token availability and price progression.
     - 1% flat fee on all buy/sell operations, enforced by the contract.
